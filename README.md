# Data-Structure-in-JS
Build all basic data structure in javascript, my favorite language without a doubt.

<br/>

When it comes to data stucture, people firstly think about python or Java which I personally don't think they are the choise. Javascript itself is a more beautiful, flexible and friendly language in the following reason:
- Runs everywhere, thanks to node
- Curly braces are the best, clear code blocks and scope
- Event-driven language, let project build in JS are more accesible and useful
- Weak type makes more sense, well I still love golang
- A better OOP class or prototype system
