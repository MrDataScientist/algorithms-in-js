# Algorithms in Javascript
Write basic data structure and algorithms in javascript, my favorite language without a doubt.

<br/>

## Why JS
When it comes to data stucture, people firstly think about python or Java which I personally don't think they are the choise. Javascript itself is a more beautiful, flexible and friendly language in the following reason:
- Runs everywhere, thanks to node
- Curly braces are the best, to have clear code blocks and scope
- Event-driven makes projects written in JS more accessible and fun
- Weak type makes more intuitive (well... I still love golang)
- A better OOP class (over than python's underscores)
- The best testing cycle
